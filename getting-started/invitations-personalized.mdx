Significance of Matching Rules
------------------------------

Matching rules ensure members connect with similar interests, enhancing interactions and community value. They foster meaningful connections, supporting a vibrant community vision. Let's first learn how to find the matching rules section.

Find the Matching Rules Section
-------------------------------

**Head to Matching > Matching Rules > Matching Form Rules**

**Choose "Matching on Similarity"**

> **Matching on Similarity Example:**
> â€‹
> Imagine you have a group of members who have indicated their preferences for weekend activities:
> 
>     - **Member 1:** Loves hiking, enjoys reading, interested in cooking
>     - **Member 2:** Enjoys hiking, loves cooking, interested in photography
>     - **Member 3:** Loves photography, enjoys cooking, interested in hiking
> 
> **Match on Similarity:**
> 
> In this case, "Match on Similarity" means that the system will pair members based on how closely their preferences align. For example:
> 
>     - **Member 1** might be matched with **Member 2** because they both enjoy hiking and have an interest in cooking.
>     - **Member 2** could also be matched with **Member 3** since they both love cooking and have an interest in another shared activity (hiking for Member 2 and photography for Member 3).
> 
> This way, members are paired with others who have similar interests, making it more likely that they'll enjoy their time together and form meaningful connections.
> â€‹
>
> *Note:* We chose "Matching on Similarity" to make things simple. We will have another article that explains the other three types of rules with in-depth examples.
