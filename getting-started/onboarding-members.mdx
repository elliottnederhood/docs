üéâ First off, Welcome to Intros AI!
-----------------------------------

We sincerely appreciate your decision to join us on this journey. We can't wait to help you get the most out of Intros AI. Let's not waste any time and ü§ø dive right in.

What Success Looks Like
-----------------------

After using Intros AI, we want you to show your peers the jaw-dropping results you were able to provide for your community. Morning Brew, On Deck, and Femtech Insider all reached these stats and we're going to help you get there too.

Your Role as Admin
------------------

As an admin, your role is crucial in creating a thriving community. We want you to feel confident in your abilities to set up a system that will create _significant value_ for your members.

Situation: You are just starting to build your database of members and want to onboard them to Intros AI. [Here's an interactive demo](https://intros-ai.navattic.com/fna90rxx) if you prefer more hands-on learning.

There are four primary ways to invite your members to Intros AI.

    1. [Email](/uploading-members/inviting-members-email)
    2. [CSV](/uploading-members/csv)
    3. [Zapier](/uploading-members/auto-update-google-sheets)
    4. [Invite Link](/uploading-members/invite-link)


If you choose to onboard from scratch, we recommend [setting up an onboarding form](https://support.intros.ai/en/articles/8955961-creating-the-matching-form) that helps collect each user's information.

Onboarding Your Members from an Existing Database like Circle
-------------------------------------------------------------

Situation: You already have an existing set of members in a living database and want to upload them to Intros AI without your members fill out the same information twice.

There are many types of databases that you members may already exist. For example:

    1. [Circle](/uploading-members/circle)
    2. [Google Sheets](/uploading-members/google-sheets)
    3. Typeform

There are two primary ways to upload with these existing databases. For example:

    1. [CSV](/uploading-members/csv)
    2. [Zapier](/uploading-members/auto-update-intros)

Onboarding Your Members from Scratch
------------------------------------

### üíå Email

**Best Use Case**: If you want to upload a few members one by one.

Onboarding Your Members from an Existing Database
-------------------------------------------------

Uploading from a CSV
--------------------
With the CSV option, Circle allows you to export your member information from Circle to Intros AI. [Here's an article from Circle that shows you how to export to a CSV](https://community.circle.so/c/product-updates/export-a-csv-of-your-members). 

Once you have the CSV exported, you're going to want to import to Intros AI. There's a way to transfer all of the categories from Circle to Intros AI.

Automatically uploading with Zapier
-----------------------------------

With Zapier, it's a little bit more complex, but definitely worth it.

You're going to want to create a new Zap. Just type "When a new member is uploaded to Circle, reflect the update in Intros AI"

Zapier will create two steps that you'll be able to add into the Zap.

Once those are connected to your desired accounts and workspaces, it should be up and running.
