Uploading from a CSV
--------------------

Circle allows you to export your member's information via CSV.

<Note>
    **Note:** A CSV file is a list of data separated by commas. For instance, it may look like the following: **Name, email, phone number, address. Example, example@example.com, 555-555-5555, Example Address**.
</Note>

**Login to your Circle Account > "Manage Members" > "Export CSV"**

With Zapier, it's a little bit more complex, but definitely worth it.
