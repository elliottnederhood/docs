Inviting Members by CSV
-----------------------

If your organization is already at a high number of members, let's say 250 people, uploading your members by CSV is a much more efficient way than one by one.

Using a CSV
-----------

**Find your CSV that you'd like to upload**

<Note>
    **Note**: A CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file is a plain text file that contains data separated by commas. For example, a CSV file might list the names and ages of students in a class like this: "John Doe,15; Jane Smith,16; Emily Johnson,15."
</Note>
**Align the Columns with IntrosAI Profile Data**

    **Note**: We are not changing anything here. We're just making the transfer by confirming the column names are accurate. 
</Note>
**Preview the Profiles to Confirm**

**Click "Next"**  
This will take you to the invitation screen which you can learn about here.
